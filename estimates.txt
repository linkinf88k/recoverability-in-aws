
1. Minimum RTO for a Single AZ Outage:
RTO for a single (AZ) outage is relatively low. When an AZ outage occurs, the database can automatically failover to the standby AZ, which is located in a different physical location. The failover process is designed to be fast and efficient, typically taking only a few minutes to complete. During this time, the database transitions to the standby AZ, ensuring minimal disruption to the application and its users. The low RTO is achieved by leveraging the synchronous replication of data between the primary and standby AZs, allowing for seamless failover and minimal downtime.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage :
RTO for a single region outage can vary depending on the specific setup and configuration. When a region outage occurs, the database fails over to the standby region, which is located in a different geographic location. The failover process typically involves redirecting traffic to the standby region and ensuring that the database services are up and running. The RTO for a single region outage can range from a few minutes to potentially longer, depending on factors such as the size of the database, the complexity of the infrastructure, and the network latency between the regions.

3. Minimum RPO for a Single AZ Outage
RPO for a single (AZ) outage is typically very low. The RPO represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss in the event of a failure. In this scenario, the database uses synchronous replication to continuously replicate data from the primary AZ to the standby AZ in real-time. This means that the standby AZ contains an up-to-date copy of the data at all times. Therefore, in the event of a failure in the primary AZ, the standby AZ can take over seamlessly with minimal data loss. The RPO can be considered near-zero, as the replicated data is almost in sync with the primary database. However, it's important to note that the actual RPO can vary based on factors such as network latency and the specific configuration of the database setup. Regular testing and monitoring of the replication process are crucial to ensure that the RPO remains within acceptable limits for your specific use case.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage :
RPO for a single region outage depends on the replication mechanism and the frequency of data synchronization between the regions. In this scenario, the database is configured with synchronous replication, which means that data is continuously replicated from the primary region to the standby region in real-time.
